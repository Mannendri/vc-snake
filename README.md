# vc-snake
This is a Python program meant to run on a Raspberry Pi that uses a TensorFlow model running on the Coral USB Accelerator. It is targeted at anyone who would like to play. It is a replica of the classic snake game that uses voice commands to control the motion of the snake and the Sense HAT 8x8 LED matrix as the display.
